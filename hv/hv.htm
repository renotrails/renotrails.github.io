<FONT COLOR=GRAY><LI>TRAIL SYNOPSIS: </FONT> &nbsp &nbsp Travels through desert shrubbery
with a few pines at higher elevations. Hike starts from the end of a residential road and
follows a jeep trail into a valley. This part is easy. Then trail narrows into a path for
hiking and biking. When trail turns off from the valley, the trail becomes steep eventually
reaching a saddle region between two hills. Views can be seen both towards Reno and
the valley to the east. The trail continues behind a hill and then follows a jeep trail to top of a higher saddle area.
Walking up this part of the trail is easy. A trail continues to the hill to the north
which is an easy walk and has views of the Reno/Sparks area. It is possible
to follow a jeep trail down the hill to the original parking place making this trail
a loop trail. The walk down is easy although at times steep.
