<li><font color="gray">TRAIL SYNOPSIS:</font> &nbsp; &nbsp; Travels
through desert shrubbery with a few pines at higher elevations.
Hike starts from the end of a residential road and follows a jeep
trail into a valley. This part is easy. Then trail narrows into a
path for hiking and biking. When trail turns off from the valley,
the trail becomes steep eventually reaching a saddle region between
two hills. Views can be seen both towards Reno and the valley to
the east. The trail continues behind a hill and then follows a jeep
trail to top of a higher saddle area. Walking up this part of the
trail is easy. A trail continues to the hill to the north which is
an easy walk and has views of the Reno/Sparks area. It is possible
to follow a jeep trail down the hill to the original parking place
making this trail a loop trail. The walk down is easy although at
times steep.</li>
