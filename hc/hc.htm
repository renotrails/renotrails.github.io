<A HREF="hc_phot.htm" TARGET="MMAP">(photograph)</A> into the Mt Rose wilderness area from desert
shubbery into an area with pines and some broad leaf trees. Hunter Creek flows
through a deep canyon with rock
outcroppings and wonderful side canyons. The trail ends in a grove of trees that is next to a waterfall.
The only major problem is the water crossings. If the water is high,
the crossings involve crossing on tree trunks. Be prepared for wet feet.
