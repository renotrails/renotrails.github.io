Hikes in the Reno-area are described. Information includes: locations of trails, directions to the
trail start, trail length, and trail directions. This is not a list all hikes in the Reno-area,
rather a list of hikes which Robert Hooper kept in a computer database
(see <A HREF="Why.htm" TARGET="MMAP">Why</A> for more details).  A map
and height cross section is included for each trail. On the map, the trail is shown in red with cicles
denoting miles and tickmarks (not always visible) denoting tenths of a mile. A list of common sense
<A HREF="rules.htm" TARGET="MMAP">rules</A> for hiking are given. As  stated in the
<A HREF="warnings.htm" TARGET="MMAP">warnings</A> section, I take no responsibility for the
accuracy of the material in this web site.
