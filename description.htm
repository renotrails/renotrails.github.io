<h1>Description Of This Web Site</h1>
</center>
Hikes in the Reno-area are described. Information includes:
locations of trails, directions to the trail start, trail length,
and trail directions. This is not a list all hikes in the
Reno-area, rather a list of hikes which Robert Hooper kept in a
computer database (see <a href="Why.htm" target="MMAP">Why</a> for
more details). A map and height cross section is included for each
trail. On the map, the trail is shown in red with cicles denoting
miles and tickmarks (not always visible) denoting tenths of a mile.
A list of common sense <a href="rules.htm" target="MMAP">rules</a>
for hiking are given. As stated in the <a href="warnings.htm"
target="MMAP">warnings</a> section, I take no responsibility for
the accuracy of the material in this web site.
