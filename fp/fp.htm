<FONT COLOR=GRAY><LI>TRAIL SYNOPSIS: </FONT> &nbsp Hike up to Armstrong Pass, turn right on Tahoe Rim Trail, and
hike to high point on Tahoe Rim Trail. This initial section of the trail is well maintained, has some wildflowers,
and offers some views of Lake Tahoe. At the high point, hike up hill over and around the boulders. Then hike
across the gravel field to the Peak. Although some intermittent trails exist, there is no well-defined trail
from the high point to the peak. There is a building on top of the peak that looks like a water tower. NOTE, the
hike from the Tahoe Rim Tail to the Peak has loose stones and steep grades. A significant risk of falls exists.
Be cautious and hike with someone. --- The National Forest Service (NFS) access road is rough and may only be
passably with a four wheel drive vehicle. A second route exists from the other side of Armstrong Pass. While
this hike is three miles longer, the road to the trail head is paved. (Drive to Route US50, turn onto Pioneer
Road and then Onida Road to reach the trail head.)
