<li><font color="gray">TRAIL SYNOPSIS:</font> &nbsp; Hike up to
Armstrong Pass, turn right on Tahoe Rim Trail, and hike to high
point on Tahoe Rim Trail. This initial section of the trail is well
maintained, has some wildflowers, and offers some views of Lake
Tahoe. At the high point, hike up hill over and around the
boulders. Then hike across the gravel field to the Peak. Although
some intermittent trails exist, there is no well-defined trail from
the high point to the peak. There is a building on top of the peak
that looks like a water tower. NOTE, the hike from the Tahoe Rim
Tail to the Peak has loose stones and steep grades. A significant
risk of falls exists. Be cautious and hike with someone. --- The
National Forest Service (NFS) access road is rough and may only be
passably with a four wheel drive vehicle. A second route exists
from the other side of Armstrong Pass. While this hike is three
miles longer, the road to the trail head is paved. (Drive to Route
US50, turn onto Pioneer Road and then Onida Road to reach the trail
head.) Photographs from Freel Peak:<br>
