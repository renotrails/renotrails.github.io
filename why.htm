<h1>Why A Web Site On Reno Trails?</h1>
</center>
Reno is unique. Many trails exist in and around Reno where people
can hike, jog, ride bikes or jeeps. Behind communities exist desert
walks, hill side walks, and even secretive valleys. In part,
Reno-area trails are unusual because Reno is near the transition
between desert and alpine environments. When a trail changes
altitude, the plants change from desert bushes to alpine trees. In
addition, if water and some shelter from wind and sun is added, a
grassland or even swampy environment can be produced. Thus during
some hikes, the plants change from desert to grassland to swampy
types. Further variation comes from the complex geology that shapes
the Reno-area and includes: granite mountains, volcanos, basaltic
lava flows, huge floods, springs/geysers, and glaciers. All this
variation makes local hikes remarkable and explains why my brother,
Robert Hooper, spent 20 years documenting these trails -- this web
site is an attempt to publish his notes.<br>
<br>
Robert's exact plans for these notes is uncertain. Did he plan to
publish them or just use them as notes for planning personal hikes?
In my discussions with his friends, one or the other of the views
have been expressed sometimes adamantly. However, Robert was still
teaching at the University when he died and I suspect he had put
off making the publishing decision until after he retired and had
more time to evaluate his notes.<br>
<br>
Roberts notes are brief, concise, and often cryptic. He references
over 120 trails in his database. Some entries duplicate other
entries. Some trails have been overtaken by development and are no
longer useful. Some entries list alternate routes and could
considered more than one trail. In the final analysis, his notes
seem to refer to between 30 and 50 trails in the 50 mile area
around Reno. I encourage Reno and Nevada residents to preserve and
document Reno-area trails.<br>
<br>
Serious hazards exist along these trails. The trails are often not
marked and are not trails in a traditional sense. Getting lost is
quite possible. Fall hazards exist -- cliffs, pits, and old mines.
Dangerous animals live in the area: poisonous snakes, coyotes, and
wild cats. Severe weather is a normal event in Reno: extreme heat
in summer; strong winter storms with significant snowfalls; and
storms with high winds. Precautions are a must when hiking these
trails.
