&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was born in Annapolis Maryland on 14
September 1938 to Edwin B. Hooper and Elizabeth W. Patrick. Robert
Hooper attended high school at Sidwell Friends and ran on the Track
Team. In 1957, he won the Washington DC Private School Mile with a
time of 4:50. He graduated from Sidwell Friends. He ran on the
Cross Country Team at John Hopkins and could run a mile in 4:30. In
1959, he developed a severe and crippling form of Ankylosing
Spondylitis (AS). In 1961, he graduated from John Hopkins
University receiving a bachelors degree. He studied mathematics at
University of Maryland and received a PhD in
1967.</font></font></font></h2>

University of Nevada at Reno for 30 years (1968-1998). He was a
co-founder of the Computer Science Department. He attended the St
Stephens Episcopal Church and was served as a vestryman for many
years. He established a ministry, which visited prisoners in
Nevada's maximum security prison. Despite his AS which severely
limited the movement of his back and leg joints, Robert started
hiking on trails in the Reno area, hiking at least once a week and
keeping computer files on the hiking trails. On a clear cool
morning -- 8 February 1998, he started hiking up Peavine Mountain
alone. After hiking three miles, he died suddenly from a heart
attack. In the afternoon, a snow storm dumped over two feet of snow
on Peavine. Despite a determined search, his body was not found and
the search was canceled after a few days. On March 18th, the
melting snow partially uncovered his body and a hiker found him.
